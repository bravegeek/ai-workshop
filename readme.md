# AI Workshop

A multi-project workspace for AI/LLM experiments, research, and development projects. This repository serves as a sandbox for exploring various AI technologies, prompt engineering, agent development, and related tools.

## Repository Structure

This workspace contains independent projects organized into specialized directories:

### Core Directories

- **`projects/`** - Individual project implementations
  - `aces-adolescent-depression-research-2025-11/` - Research project on adolescent depression
  - `cosmos-and-chaos-2025-11/` - Game design and implementation
  - `roast-my-writing-2025-11/` - Writing critique agent
  - `satirical-article-agent-2025-11/` - Satirical content generation agent

- **`personas/`** - AI persona definitions and role configurations
  - Azure Architect persona
  - PowerShell Expert persona
  - Technical Project Manager persona
  - The Visual Alchemist persona

- **`prompts/`** - Prompt templates and engineering experiments
  - CRIT strategic thinking framework

- **`sessions/`** - Working session notes and outputs
  - Satirical articles and other generated content

### Configuration

- **`CLAUDE.md`** - Instructions and conventions for Claude Code
- **`GEMINI.md`** - Instructions for Google Gemini
- **`.claude/`** - Claude Code IDE configuration
- **`.gemini/`** - Gemini-specific configuration

## Getting Started

Each project in the `projects/` directory is self-contained with its own:
- Documentation (README.md, design docs, specs)
- Dependencies and requirements
- Build/run instructions
- Independent versioning

To work on a specific project:

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd projects/<project-name>/`
2. Read the project's documentation
3. Follow project-specific setup instructions

## Project Philosophy

This workspace follows these principles:

- **Independence** - Each project is self-contained and can be worked on separately
- **Experimentation** - Projects may be in various states of completion; this is a learning environment
- **Documentation** - Each project maintains its own documentation and context
- **Flexibility** - No enforced conventions across projects; each uses appropriate tools and patterns

## AI Assistant Integration

This repository is optimized for use with AI coding assistants:

- Claude Code configuration in `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`
- Gemini configuration in `GEMINI.md` and `.gemini/`
- Structured directories for AI-specific resources (personas, prompts, workflows)

## Contributing

This is a personal workshop repository. Each project directory is independent and may have different contribution guidelines or be for personal use only.

## License

Projects within this workspace may have individual licenses. Check each project directory for specific licensing information.
