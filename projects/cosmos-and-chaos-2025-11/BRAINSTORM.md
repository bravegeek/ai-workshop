# Cosmos and Chaos - Brainstorming Session

## Game Concept

**Name:** Cosmos and Chaos

**Genre:** Idle Clicker Game with Real-Time Strategy Elements

**Core Mechanic:** Player defends a starbase positioned in the center of the screen from incoming asteroids

## Design Philosophy

**Progressive Design Approach:**
- Don't need to know the ending to get started
- Iterative development mindset
- Build and expand organically

**Core Strategic Vision:**
- Player progresses up a technology tree
- Key tension: **balancing immediate benefits vs long-term benefits**
- Trade-offs between "benefits now vs benefits later"

## CRI Brainstorming Session Progress

**Framework:** Context, Role, Interview
**Expert Role:** Strategic Game Designer (player psychology and meaningful choice design)
**Focus Area:** Game Design & Mechanics

### Phase 1: Context ✓

Established core concept and design philosophy (see above)

### Phase 2: Role ✓

Selected **Strategic Game Designer** role - focusing on:
- Decision tension
- Risk/reward balance
- Pacing
- Making choices feel impactful without overwhelming players

### Phase 3: Interview (In Progress)

#### Question 1: Decision Point Frequency ✓

**Decision:** Real-time decision-making during waves

Players make technology tree decisions continuously during waves, not between them. This creates:
- Active gameplay with constant strategic pressure
- Real-time tension between spending NOW vs saving for long-term upgrades
- Dynamic decision-making environment

#### Question 2: Technology Tree Interaction Model ✓

**Decision:** Hybrid - Persistent Sidebar + Contextual Highlights

Interface design:
- **Persistent sidebar** showing full tech tree at all times
- **Contextual highlights/pop-ups** that intelligently suggest relevant upgrades based on current situation
- Players can explore freely but get guidance to prevent decision paralysis
- Quick-access without pausing the action

Benefits:
- Constant visibility and accessibility
- Smart guidance reduces cognitive load
- Creates good learning curve
- Prevents overwhelming new players

#### Question 3: Tech Tree Progression Model ✓

**Decision:** Hybrid - Unlocks + Flexible Investment

Progression system:
- **Foundational Prerequisites:** Core defensive/economic systems built in sequence (e.g., Basic Shields → Advanced Shields → Energy Barriers)
- **Flexible Investment Pool:** Some powerful technologies always visible but cost-gated, allowing players to save for big jumps
- **Breakthrough Moments:** Certain key technologies unlock entire new branches (e.g., "Quantum Research" opens quantum-based defense tree)
- **Strategic Tension:** Balance building foundations vs saving for breakthroughs vs exploiting immediate tactical opportunities

#### Question 4: Technology Acquisition Mechanics (Current)

**Under Consideration:** How players actually acquire and upgrade technologies during gameplay

Options being evaluated:
- **A.** Wave-Pause Research System (structured planning windows)
- **B.** Real-Time Passive Research (background research with queuing)
- **C.** Active Resource Investment (manual allocation during waves)
- **D.** Hybrid: Instant Purchase + Passive Unlocks (tactical + strategic split)

## Key Design Decisions Summary

| Aspect | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Decision Timing** | Real-time during waves | Active engagement, constant strategic pressure |
| **UI/UX** | Persistent sidebar + contextual highlights | Accessibility + guidance without overwhelm |
| **Progression** | Hybrid (prerequisites + flexible + breakthroughs) | Strategic depth with freedom and clear goals |
| **Acquisition** | TBD | Next decision point |
