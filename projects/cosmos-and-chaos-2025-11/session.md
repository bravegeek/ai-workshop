# Cosmos and Chaos - Brainstorming Session

## Game Concept

**Name:** Cosmos and Chaos

**Genre:** Idle Game with Progressive Discovery

**Core Mechanic:** Asteroid mining and space-based resource refining with technology tree progression

**Game Nature:**
- **Idle game** - Low stress, casual experience
- **Survival is guaranteed** - Player cannot die/fail
- **Real challenge** - Technology upgrade choices and optimization
- **Not a survival game** - Asteroid interaction is thematic, not threatening

## Design Philosophy

**Progressive Design Approach:**
- Don't need to know the ending to get started
- Iterative development mindset
- Build and expand organically

**Core Strategic Vision:**
- Player progresses up a technology tree
- Key tension: **balancing immediate benefits vs long-term benefits**
- Trade-offs between "benefits now vs benefits later"

---

## Story & Universe

**Setting:**
- Mankind now lives among the planets
- Orbital manufacturing has blossomed
- Need for raw materials has soared
- Cheap fusion power makes asteroid mining profitable
- Raw materials extracted from asteroids and refined in space

**Starting Point:**
- Player begins as a **lonely asteroid miner**
- Small-scale operation in the early days of the mining boom
- Part of humanity's expanding industrial presence in space

**Narrative Arc: Mystery/Discovery**
- Mining is just the beginning
- Something larger is revealed as player ventures deeper into space
- Progressive discovery aligns with iterative design philosophy
- "Don't need every detail upfront" fits naturally with discovery theme

**Three Player Paths:**
Players choose one of three philosophical approaches (interpretive lenses):

1. **Industrial Magnate - "Haunted Tycoon"**
   - Build economic empire through asteroid mining
   - Leans toward Dread (pragmatic extraction)
   - Key tension: success has psychological cost

2. **Intrepid Explorer - "Thrillseeker"**
   - Discover and map the unknown cosmos
   - Leans toward Wonder (curiosity-driven)
   - Key tension: from excitement to profound truth

3. **The Witness - "Observer of Truth"**
   - Understand fundamental reality through observation
   - Balanced between Wonder and Dread
   - Key tension: achieving clarity about what truly is

These paths create replayability (12 possible endings: 3 paths × 4 emotional quadrants) and player agency while maintaining thematic unity under the "Cosmos and Chaos" theme.

## CRI Brainstorming Session Progress

### Session 1: Game Design & Mechanics

**Framework:** Context, Role, Interview
**Expert Role:** Strategic Game Designer (player psychology and meaningful choice design)
**Focus Area:** Game Design & Mechanics

### Phase 1: Context ✓

Established core concept and design philosophy (see above)

### Phase 2: Role ✓

Selected **Strategic Game Designer** role - focusing on:
- Decision tension
- Risk/reward balance
- Pacing
- Making choices feel impactful without overwhelming players

### Phase 3: Interview (In Progress)

#### Question 1: Decision Point Frequency ✓

**Decision:** Real-time decision-making during waves

Players make technology tree decisions continuously during waves, not between them. This creates:
- Active gameplay with constant strategic pressure
- Real-time tension between spending NOW vs saving for long-term upgrades
- Dynamic decision-making environment

#### Question 2: Technology Tree Interaction Model ✓

**Decision:** Hybrid - Persistent Sidebar + Contextual Highlights

Interface design:
- **Persistent sidebar** showing full tech tree at all times
- **Contextual highlights/pop-ups** that intelligently suggest relevant upgrades based on current situation
- Players can explore freely but get guidance to prevent decision paralysis
- Quick-access without pausing the action

Benefits:
- Constant visibility and accessibility
- Smart guidance reduces cognitive load
- Creates good learning curve
- Prevents overwhelming new players

#### Question 3: Tech Tree Progression Model ✓

**Decision:** Hybrid - Unlocks + Flexible Investment

Progression system:
- **Foundational Prerequisites:** Core defensive/economic systems built in sequence (e.g., Basic Shields → Advanced Shields → Energy Barriers)
- **Flexible Investment Pool:** Some powerful technologies always visible but cost-gated, allowing players to save for big jumps
- **Breakthrough Moments:** Certain key technologies unlock entire new branches (e.g., "Quantum Research" opens quantum-based defense tree)
- **Strategic Tension:** Balance building foundations vs saving for breakthroughs vs exploiting immediate tactical opportunities

#### Question 4: Technology Acquisition Mechanics (Resumed)

**Under Consideration:** How players actually acquire and upgrade technologies during gameplay

*Session initially paused to refine game nature and narrative direction*

**Question Refined for Idle Game Nature:**

After clarifying the game as an idle experience (not defense-focused), the acquisition options were refined:

**Options:**

**A. Purchase-on-Demand System (Classic Idle)**
- Resources accumulate automatically from mining
- Player clicks to purchase/upgrade techs when affordable
- Instant application of purchased upgrades
- *Feel:* Active clicking moments amid passive income (Cookie Clicker, AdVenture Capitalist)

**B. Auto-Purchase with Priority Queue**
- Player sets research priority queue (drag to reorder)
- System auto-purchases next tech when resources available
- Player adjusts queue anytime to change direction
- *Feel:* Strategic planning with hands-off execution (Idle Skilling, Melvor Idle)

**C. Hybrid: Manual Purchase + Auto-Unlock Milestones**
- Most techs: manual purchase when affordable
- Landmark techs: unlock automatically at milestones (triggering narrative moments)
- *Feel:* Player agency for tactics, destiny-driven for story beats

**D. Time-Gated Research Slots**
- 1-3 "research slots" that work on techs over time
- Player assigns which tech to each slot
- Resources consumed upfront, tech completes after X time
- Can speed up with boosters or cancel to reassign
- *Feel:* Strategic commitment with planning ahead (EVE Online skill training)

*Decision pending - paused to explore production unit first*

#### Question 5: Basic Production Unit

**Context:** Before finalizing acquisition mechanics, explored what players are actually producing.

**Decision:** Start with simple "metal" mining

**Rationale:**
- Simple and familiar for initial gameplay
- Accessible entry point (no abstract concepts)
- Creates foundation for complexity to emerge naturally
- Allows game to evolve the resource system as player progresses

**Evolution Plan:**
- Early game: Simple metal mining (straightforward, industrial)
- Mid-late game: Metal evolves to incorporate Wonder/Dread themes
- Resource transformation reflects player's progression into mystery/discovery

#### Question 6: Resource Evolution Mechanics (In Progress)

**Question:** How should metal evolve into wonder/dread resources?

**Options Under Consideration:**

**(A) Gradual Blend**
- Metal slowly gains wonder/dread properties as you progress
- Examples: "Resonant Metal" (50% wonder), "Unstable Alloy" (dread properties)
- *Feel:* Smooth thematic shift, gradual revelation

**(B) Branching Fork**
- At a certain point, metal mining splits into two paths
- One leans into wonder, another into dread
- *Feel:* Discrete moment of choice, clear decision point

**(C) Transformation Gates**
- Specific discoveries/events transform entire operation
- Example: Discovering an anomaly changes mining fundamentally
- *Feel:* Dramatic story moments, watershed events

**(D) Parallel Systems**
- Metal stays metal
- New wonder/dread resources discovered alongside it
- *Feel:* Expanding complexity, accumulating systems

**Why This Matters:**
Affects whether players experience gradual thematic shift versus discrete moments of change, which impacts emotional pacing. Also connects to technology tree structure and narrative progression.

*Decision pending*

#### Session 1 Continuation (2025-11-26): Resource System Deep Dive ✓

**Expert Role:** Narrative-Mechanical Integration Specialist

After establishing the basic production unit (metal) and resource evolution approach (discovery, not transformation), explored how resource discovery integrates mechanics and narrative.

**Question 1: Resource Discovery Pacing**

**Decision:** Mixed Approach - Progressive Escalation

- **Basic Exotic Resources:** Gradual recognition (looks ordinary, reveals strangeness through interaction)
- **Deep Anomalous Resources:** Immediate impact (visibly strange/impossible from first sight)
- **Throughout:** Lore and mysterious signals provide breadcrumbs

**Rationale:**
- Creates natural narrative arc from scientific curiosity to cosmic revelation
- Early: "What is this?" (subtle investigation)
- Later: "This shouldn't exist" (overwhelming discovery)
- Supports both Wonder (gradual understanding) and Dread (sudden horror) experiences

**Question 2: Resource Narrative Integration**

**Major Breakthrough: Quadrant-Based Narrative Revelation**

Instead of choosing one narrative model (Archaeological, Transformation, Consciousness, or Forbidden Knowledge), resources reveal different facets of the mystery based on their Wonder/Dread alignment.

**Core Principle:**
The mystery isn't "what happened?" - it's "what happened AND what does it mean?" The answer changes based on which emotional lens (resource type) you use to investigate.

**Example: The Architects' Final Transmission (Same Event, Four Interpretations)**

| Quadrant | Resources | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **High Wonder, Low Dread** | Stellar Harmonics, Consciousness Crystals | "They transcended. The transmission is an invitation to join the cosmic consciousness." |
| **High Wonder, High Dread** | Void Resonators, Paradox Engines | "They exist in quantum superposition - simultaneously enlightened and annihilated. Both/neither is true." |
| **Low Wonder, High Dread** | Temporal Scars, Forbidden Archives | "They're trapped in a digital hell. The transmission is a warning: don't follow our path." |
| **Low Wonder, Low Dread** | Ancient Alloys, Archaeological Data | "They just failed and died. The transmission is automated noise creating illusion of meaning." |

**All four interpretations are simultaneously true.** The emotional truth matters more than literal truth.

**Connection to Player Paths:**

- **Industrial Magnate:** Natural Low Wonder/Low Dread (pragmatic) → sees cautionary tale about efficiency
- **Intrepid Explorer:** Natural High Wonder (variable Dread) → sees transformation/discovery narrative
- **The Witness:** Natural High Wonder/High Dread (sublime) → holds multiple contradictory truths simultaneously

**Resource-Driven Narrative Examples:**

**Stellar Harmonics (High Wonder, Low Dread):**
- Discovery: "Rhythmic patterns in stellar radiation. The Architects encoded music into stars."
- Unlocks: Consciousness Crystal tech tree
- Narrative: "They didn't die - they became conductors of the cosmic symphony"
- Effect: Pushes toward Transcendence endings

**Temporal Scar (Low Wonder, High Dread):**
- Discovery: "Causality breaks down. You see your own wreckage before you've crashed. This is wrong."
- Unlocks: Forbidden Archives tech tree
- Narrative: "They broke time. They're stuck in infinite loop, reliving extinction forever"
- Effect: Pushes toward Dread endings

**Meta-Design Principle:**
Each resource type is a lens for interpreting the same underlying mystery. Industrial players see ruins, Explorer players see temples, Witness players see both simultaneously.

**Replayability:**
Players naturally want to replay to experience the mystery through different emotional lenses and see how the "truth" changes based on Wonder/Dread balance.

**Open Design Questions:**
1. Should every narrative fragment have four quadrant interpretations, or just key moments?
2. How explicit should this system be to players?
3. Do the 12 endings need refinement with this quadrant-based narrative system?

*Session paused for documentation - Interview Phase to continue with Q3 (pacing/implementation details)*

### Session 2: Narrative & Universe Development ✓

**Focus:** Developing the story, universe, and mystery/discovery narrative arc

**Framework:** Context, Role, Interview
**Expert Role:** Narrative Systems Designer (environmental storytelling, mystery through mechanics)

#### Phase 1: Context ✓

**Game Nature Refined:**
- Clarified as idle game where survival is guaranteed
- Challenge is technology optimization, not survival
- Shifted from "defense" framing to "mining/industrial" framing
- Only player interaction: choosing upgrades from technology tree

**Story Foundation Established:**
- Lonely asteroid miner start
- Orbital manufacturing economy
- Cheap fusion power enables profitability
- Mystery/Discovery narrative arc
- Multiple player goal paths

#### Phase 2: Role ✓

Selected **Narrative Systems Designer** role - expert in:
- Environmental storytelling
- Mystery-building through mechanics (not exposition)
- Integrating narrative with gameplay
- Story through discovery

#### Phase 3: Interview ✓

**Question 1: Mystery's Emotional Arc**
- **Decision:** Player chooses between Wonder and Unease interpretations
- Hybrid approach: emergent based on gameplay behavior
- Tech tree choices reveal emotional lens

**Question 2: Two-Dimensional Emotional Framework**
- **Critical Design Decision:** Wonder and Dread are INDEPENDENT dimensions (not opposites)
- **Wonder Axis:** "How beautiful/amazing is this?"
- **Dread Axis:** "What is this costing me/the universe?"
- Creates four emotional quadrants:
  - High Wonder, Low Dread = Pure discovery, optimistic exploration
  - High Wonder, High Dread = The Sublime, profound tragedy
  - Low Wonder, High Dread = Horror/despair, exploitation
  - Low Wonder, Low Dread = Mundane, routine operations

**Question 3: Behavioral Tracking Through Tech Choices**
- **Constraint:** Only player action is choosing upgrades
- Tech tree IS the narrative interface
- Each upgrade choice reveals emotional lens
- Wonder-aligned techs: study, preserve, peaceful approaches
- Dread-generating techs: extraction, exploitation, aggressive approaches

**Question 4: Weighting Sensitivity**
- **Decision:** Gentle Gradients (Subtle, Forgiving System)
- Most technologies: mild weights (1-2 points)
- Few landmark technologies: strong weights (3-5 points)
- Wide threshold ranges = gradual narrative shifts
- Players can rebalance interpretation through later choices
- Organic emergence, freedom to explore

**Question 5: Goals as Interpretive Lenses**
- **Decision:** Goals Are Lenses, Not Positions (Option D)
- 2D emotional space is universal (same for all goals)
- Goal determines which quadrant unlocks which ending
- Same emotional state means different things for different goals
- Creates 3 paths × 4 quadrants = **12 possible endings**

**Question 6-7: Three Player Paths Finalized**

1. **Industrial Magnate - "Haunted Tycoon"**
   - Philosophy: Building empire, economic achievement
   - Default leaning: Unease/Dread (pragmatic, extraction-focused)
   - Narrative voice: Starts confident, becomes disturbed by exploitation
   - Dread management: Hybrid system (tech + context + thresholds)
   - Key tension: "The more we take, the less human we become"
   - Can ease dread through Wonder-aligned choices

2. **Intrepid Explorer - "Thrillseeker"**
   - Philosophy: Discovery, exploration, mapping the unknown
   - Default leaning: Wonder (curiosity-driven, optimistic)
   - Narrative voice: Excitement, awe, cosmic discovery
   - Key tension: From thrill to profound understanding (or terror)

3. **The Witness - "Observer of Truth"**
   - Philosophy: Understanding fundamental nature of reality through observation
   - Default leaning: Balanced (open to both wonder and dread equally)
   - Narrative voice: Contemplative, patient, philosophical
   - Key tension: From curiosity to comprehension of what truly *is*
   - Player fantasy: Sage seeking enlightenment through pure observation
   - Gameplay: Patience-driven (observe, understand, achieve insight)

**Twelve Ending Framework:**
Each path interprets the same emotional state differently:
- Example: (High Wonder, High Dread)
  - Explorer: "The universe is beautiful and terrible" (cosmic sublime)
  - Industrial Magnate: "I've built something magnificent that horrifies me" (Frankenstein's crown)
  - Witness: "To see clearly is both gift and curse" (terrible gnosis)

#### Session 2 Outcomes

**Narrative Architecture Established:**
- ✓ 2D emotional space (Wonder × Dread, independent axes)
- ✓ Technology tree as narrative tracking system
- ✓ Gentle Gradients weighting for organic emergence
- ✓ Goals as interpretive lenses (same data, different meaning)
- ✓ 12 distinct ending scenarios
- ✓ Three philosophically distinct player paths

#### Visual Design

**What It Is:**
- Small window showing a starfield (like looking through a porthole into space)
- **Size:** ~150x150 pixels (minimap-sized)
- **Location:** Top-right corner (unobtrusive, persistent)
- **Style:** Telescope eyepiece or observatory window aesthetic

**Core Mechanics:**

1. **Wonder = Star Brightness**
   - Low Wonder: Dim, distant pinpricks of light
   - Medium Wonder: Clear, steady starlight (warm colors: gold, white-gold)
   - High Wonder: Bright, glowing stars with gentle twinkle (like desert night sky)
   - **Feeling:** Hope, revelation, beauty

2. **Dread = Star Density**
   - Low Dread: Normal, peaceful starfield with comfortable spacing
   - Medium Dread: Stars clustering closer, becoming dense
   - High Dread: Stars packed tightly in wrong colors (deep red, purple, sickly green)
   - **Feeling:** Oppressive, watching, uncaring infinite

#### Visual States Examples

**High Wonder, Low Dread (Discovery Path):**
- Brilliant stars like beacons across darkness
- Beautiful and inviting atmosphere

**Low Wonder, High Dread (Horror Path):**
- Crowded stars in unnatural colors
- Stars that stare, not twinkle

**High Wonder, High Dread (Sublime Path):**

- Properties to modulate:
  - Brightness: Wonder level (0-100%)
  - Density: Dread level (controls spawn count)
  - Color: Interpolate warm (Wonder) → cold/wrong (Dread)
- Transitions: Smooth fade/shift over 2-3 seconds
- Animation: Subtle pulse/twinkle tied to Wonder

#### Mechanical Effects of Wonder/Dread

**1. Mining Yield Modulation (5-15% variance)**
- Wonder: Better yields on unusual/rare asteroids (+perception)
- Dread: Better automation efficiency (+tension driving productivity)

**2. Tech Tree Gates**
- Wonder-locked techs: "Stellar Cartography" (8+), "Quantum Scanner" (15+)
- Dread-locked techs: "Deep Void Sensors" (8+), "Isolation Protocols" (15+)
- Balanced techs: "Observer's Toolkit" (Wonder 15 + Dread 15) for Witness

**3. Event Frequency Shifts**
- High Wonder: +30% discovery events (signals, anomalies, lore)
- High Dread: +30% existential events (void whispers, isolation thoughts)
- Both high: Witness-specific philosophical encounters

**4. Aesthetic Transformation**
- Wonder: Warmer tones, stars closer, harmonic mining sounds
- Dread: Darker UI, emptier space, deep bass hums, echoes
- Balanced: Crisp clarity, neutral palette, minimal soundscape

### Session 3: Technology Tree Design ✓

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Focus:** Technology tree structure, Wonder/Dread weighting, and progression design
**Expert Role:** Game Systems Designer (progression curves, balance, meaningful choice)

#### Session Summary

This session focused on designing the concrete technology tree for Cosmos and Chaos, building on the 11-branch framework established in previous sessions. We defined 17 technologies across Early Game (Tiers 0-1) and Mid Game (Tiers 2-3), establishing Wonder/Dread weights, unlock requirements, and progression philosophy.

**Key Achievement:** Balanced progression curve that starts neutral (industrial mining focus) and gradually introduces Wonder and Dread themes through meaningful player choices.

#### Technology Design Framework

**The Four Archetypal Paths:**

Technologies are designed to support different emotional journeys through the game:

**1. Comfort Path (Low Wonder, Low Dread)**
- Routine, efficient operations
- Competence and mastery satisfaction
- Industrial achievement without cosmic weight
- Example: "I'm just really good at mining"

**2. Awe Path (High Wonder, Low Dread)**
- Pure discovery and exploration
- Scientific curiosity fulfilled
- Optimistic space-age progress
- Example: "The universe is amazing and I'm learning its secrets"

**3. Horror Path (Low Wonder, High Dread)**
- Exploitation and consequences
- Isolation and existential weight
- Industrial horror realization
- Example: "I've gone too far and lost something essential"

**4. Cosmic/Sublime Path (High Wonder, High Dread)**
- Beautiful and terrible simultaneously
- Profound understanding with heavy cost
- The price of enlightenment
- Example: "I see the truth and it's magnificent and horrifying"

**Progression Curve Philosophy:**

**Early Game (Tiers 0-1):**
- Mostly 0/0 neutral (familiar industrial operations)
- Minimal Wonder introductions (+1 W maximum)
- Zero Dread (no cosmic weight yet)
- **Purpose:** Establish baseline, teach mechanics, create comfort zone

**Mid Game (Tiers 2-3):**
- Wonder and Dread both increase
- Balanced but Dread-leaning (reflects mystery deepening)
- Players start making meaningful emotional choices
- **Purpose:** Introduce tension, reveal strangeness, create stakes

**Late Game (Tiers 4-5) - Not Yet Designed:**
- Wonder and Dread escalate significantly
- Clear path differentiation emerges
- Landmark choices (3-5 point weights)
- **Purpose:** Commit to emotional trajectory, meaningful consequences

**Endgame (Tier 6+) - Not Yet Designed:**
- Extreme Wonder and/or Dread values (4-6+ points)
- Path-defining technologies
- Lead to specific endings
- **Purpose:** Culmination of player's emotional journey

**Wonder and Dread as Independent Dimensions:**

**Wonder Axis:**
- Measures discovery, understanding, beauty, cosmic significance
- "How amazing/beautiful/profound is this?"
- Sources: Scientific breakthroughs, ancient mysteries, consciousness expansion

**Dread Axis:**
- Measures cost, isolation, existential weight, consequences
- "What am I losing/risking/becoming?"
- Sources: Exploitation, deep time, loneliness, transformation

**Key Principle:** Wonder and Dread are NOT opposites. You can have:
- High Wonder + High Dread = The Sublime (beautiful terror)
- Low Wonder + Low Dread = The Mundane (routine operations)
- High Wonder + Low Dread = Pure Discovery (optimistic exploration)
- Low Wonder + High Dread = Pure Horror (extraction without meaning)

#### Technology Tree Balance Summary

**Cumulative Totals (Tiers 0-3):**

**Total Technologies Designed:** 17
**Total Wonder:** +11
**Total Dread:** +12
**Net Balance:** Slightly Dread-leaning (+1 Dread)

**Balance by Tier:**

| Tier | Technologies | Wonder | Dread | Net Balance |

**Design Rationale:**

**Why Slightly Dread-Leaning?**
1. **Narrative Arc:** Mystery naturally introduces unease as it deepens
2. **Contrast Setup:** Early neutral baseline makes mid-game weight feel significant
3. **Path Support:** Allows Industrial Magnate (default Dread) and Witness (balanced) paths to feel natural
4. **Late Game Room:** Leaves space for Wonder to catch up or Dread to escalate in Tiers 4-6+
5. **Player Agency:** Players can choose Wonder-heavy techs to balance if desired

**Progression Philosophy:**
- Early game: Comfort zone (familiar, safe, industrial)
- Mid game: Mystery introduction (strange but manageable)
- Late game: Commitment (path divergence, meaningful choices)
- Endgame: Culmination (extreme values, endings)

#### Remaining Work: Late Game & Endgame

**Late Game (Tiers 4-5) - To Be Designed:**

**Target Count:** 12-15 technologies
**Estimated Wonder/Dread Range:** Individual techs 2-4 points, landmarks 4-5 points
**Purpose:** Path differentiation and meaningful commitment

**Branches to Expand:**
- **Scientific Research** (currently 0 techs) - Theoretical breakthroughs, cross-tree synergies
- **Legacy & Propagation** (currently 0 techs) - Self-replication, monuments, successor systems
- **Advanced Consciousness** - Identity dissolution vs cosmic awareness
- **Deep Xenoarchaeology** - Understanding the Architects, activating artifacts
- **Temporal Manipulation** - Moving beyond speed into causality
- **Advanced Habitat** - Thriving ecosystems vs sterile survival
- **Signal Response Systems** - Deciding whether to answer the void

**Key Design Goals:**
1. Create clear Wonder-heavy and Dread-heavy paths
2. Introduce landmark choices (3-5 point swings)
3. Support all four player paths distinctly
4. Foreshadow ending trajectories
5. Create meaningful trade-offs (can't have everything)

**Endgame (Tier 6+) - To Be Designed:**

**Target Count:** 8-12 technologies
**Estimated Wonder/Dread Range:** 4-6+ points per tech
**Purpose:** Final trajectory lock, ending determination

**Branch Focus:**
- **Consciousness (Transcendence)** - Becoming vs losing self
- **Legacy (Propagation)** - Beautiful legacy vs industrial horror
- **Xenoarchaeology (Truth)** - Following the Architects' path
- **Synthesis (Reality-Bending)** - Creating vs destroying
- **Temporal (Deep Time)** - Operations spanning eons

**Ending Gates:**
Each quadrant needs 2-3 ultimate technologies that define final state:
- **Comfort Ending:** Low W/Low D techs (routine mastery)
- **Awe Ending:** High W/Low D techs (transcendent discovery)
- **Horror Ending:** Low W/High D techs (industrial nightmare)
- **Sublime Ending:** High W/High D techs (terrible enlightenment)

#### Design Principles Established

**1. Progression Curve:**
- Start neutral/familiar
- Introduce themes gradually
- Escalate meaningfully
- Create clear inflection points

**2. Player Agency:**
- No forced paths
- Can rebalance trajectory
- Gentle gradients allow exploration
- Landmarks create commitment moments

**3. Branch Philosophy:**
Each branch serves specific emotional purpose:
- **Extraction, Logistics, Temporal (early)** = Comfort baseline
- **Exploration, Research** = Wonder sources
- **Signals, Xenoarchaeology** = Mystery/Dread sources
- **Consciousness, Synthesis** = Transformation (high stakes)
- **Habitat** = Isolation reflection
- **Legacy** = Endgame meaning-making

**4. Description Writing:**
Technology descriptions should:
- Start with mechanical/scientific framing
- Introduce emotional undertone subtly
- Avoid explicit "this is scary" statements
- Let implications speak for themselves
- Use second person ("you feel...") for connection

**5. Cost Scaling:**
- Tier 0: 50-150 Metal
- Tier 1: 300-700 Metal
- Tier 2: 2000-3500 Metal
- Tier 3: 5000-10,000 Metal + Exotic Matter
- Future tiers will introduce additional resource types

#### Session Meta Notes

**What Worked:**
- Four archetypal paths framework provides clear design direction
- Independent Wonder/Dread dimensions create nuanced choices
- Progression curve philosophy (neutral → mystery → weight) feels natural
- Technology descriptions successfully blend mechanics and emotion

**Design Insights:**
- Early game needs to be boring (creates contrast for later strangeness)
- Xenoarchaeology Kit as first major landmark (5 points) felt right
- Consciousness technologies naturally high-stakes (identity questions)
- Habitat branch is pure atmospheric Dread (isolation without wonder)

**Challenges Remaining:**
- Need to design Scientific Research branch (0 techs so far)
- Legacy & Propagation needs careful framing (empire vs horror)
- Balancing four paths while maintaining shared tech tree
- Ensuring 4 path endings all feel distinct and satisfying

**Questions for Future Sessions:**
1. Should every technology be available to all paths, or should some be path-exclusive?
2. How explicit should ending thresholds be to players?
3. Should late-game introduce resource types beyond Metal/Exotic Matter?
4. How many landmark technologies (4-5+ points) is the right number?

#### Cosmic Lens Discussion (In Progress)

**Context:** Discussed implementation details for the Wonder/Dread feedback widget

**Key Questions Identified:**
1. **Appearance Timing:** First landmark tech, cumulative threshold, or narrative gate?
2. **Transition Style:** Gradual fade-in, sudden manifestation, or environmental build-up?
3. **Update Triggers:** Continuous (every tech) or discrete (landmarks only)?
4. **Information Display:** Absolute state only, or trajectory/momentum?
5. **Metaphysics:** Internal phenomenon, external reality, or both/neither?

**Agent Analysis:**
- Cosmic Lens is "phenomenological mirror" of player's emotional state
- Starfield viewport: brightness = Wonder, density = Dread
- Should appear after emotional threshold (design question: which threshold?)
- Could evolve from passive feedback to active decision-making tool
- Path-dependent interpretation paths could show different visual styles or interpretations
