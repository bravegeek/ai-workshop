### Agent Reasoning & Design Process

Following the definition of the Storage Mechanics, the user requested specific technologies to implement these concepts.

1.  **Tech Placement:** We identified **Tier 2** as the logical place for advanced storage, branching off from `T07: Automated Sorting` (Tier 1 Logistics).
2.  **Technology Design:**
    *   **Wonder: T35 Matter Compression.** Implements the "Archive" concept. The mechanical hook is the "Pressure Feed" (refinery speed bonus when full), rewarding players for maintaining high stock levels efficiently.
    *   **Dread: T36 External Cargo Webbing.** Implements the "Hoard" concept. The hook is "Overfill" (200% capacity) with a "Drag" penalty (thruster efficiency), creating a risk/reward trade-off suitable for Dread.
3.  **Integration:**
    *   Updated the Mermaid diagram to include the new branch.
    *   Updated the detailed list.
    *   Updated the "Logistics & Automation" branch count in the summary table.
4.  **Outcome:** The tech tree now has 36 total technologies, maintaining perfect Wonder/Dread symmetry (+41/+41) while adding depth to the Logistics branch.
