## Session 18 Meta-Analysis (2025-11-27) - Xenoarchaeology Artifacts & Final Polish

### Session Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-11-27
- **Focus:** Detailing the "Xenoarchaeology" artifact system and final tech tree polish.
- **Model Used:** Gemini
- **Search Queries:** None (internal analysis and creative brainstorming)

### Agent Reasoning & Design Process

This session focused on finalizing the mechanics for the Xenoarchaeology branch and ensuring the artifact system provides meaningful gameplay choices.

1.  **Artifact Naming & Flavor:**
    *   Renamed **T09 Surface Scavenging** to **Anomaly Harvesting** to sound more technical and intentional.
    *   Renamed "Unidentified Shards" to **"Fractal Echoes"** to align with the Wonder/Dread themes of resonance and mystery.
2.  **Artifact Progression System:** Defined a clear 4-tier progression for artifacts:
    *   **Tier 1 (Discovery):** *Fractal Echoes*. Consumables for small, random buffs. Keeps the early game active.
    *   **Tier 2 (Analysis):** *Blueprints vs. Conduits*. Research outcomes that offer either passive modules (Wonder) or risky overclock modules (Dread).
    *   **Tier 3 (Choice):** *Relics*. Powerful items that force a "Integrate vs. Activate" decision, directly trading stability for burst power + Dissonance.
    *   **Tier 4 (Mastery):** *Primal Cores*. Permanent, game-altering milestones (Harmony Core to reduce Dread penalties vs. Chaos Core for god-like active abilities).
3.  **Visual Polish:** Significantly increased the font sizes in the Mermaid diagram (Standard 30px, Heavy 36px, Landmark 40px) to ensure readability in the final document.
4.  **Final State:** The game design document (`session.md`) is now comprehensive, covering the full 48-tech tree, all 5 Tiers, core mechanics (Wonder/Dread, Crew, Dissonance), and specific subsystems (Artifacts, Energy, Propulsion, Habitat).

**Project Status:** The initial design phase for "Cosmos and Chaos" is effectively complete. The document serves as a robust blueprint for implementation.
