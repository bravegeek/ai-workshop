### Agent Reasoning & Design Process

This session aimed to transform a basic "Cargo Bay" tech into a central strategic mechanic that reinforces the core Wonder/Dread choices.

1.  **Addressing the "Cargo Bay" Ambiguity:** The initial `T03 Cargo Bay I` was a vague stat increase. The goal was to make storage a meaningful decision point.
2.  **Blending Core Idle Mechanics:** We combined "Global Cap" (classic progression gate) with "Overflow Buffer" (Factorio-lite production buffer). This ensures storage is critical both for unlocking new technologies and for optimizing idle gains over long periods.
3.  **Thematic Integration (Wonder/Dread):**
    *   **Wonder Storage ("The Archive"):** Focused on efficiency and conceptual manipulation of space (compression). Rewards intelligent layout and provides flow bonuses (Refining Speed).
    *   **Dread Storage ("The Hoard"):** Focused on risky, brute-force expansion beyond safe limits (over-capacity). Introduces "Structural Stress" and "Hull Breaches" as direct consequences of aggressive hoarding, reinforcing the game's risk/reward Dread theme.
4.  **Tech Tree Update:** `T03 Cargo Bay I` was updated in the detailed tech list to reflect its foundational role in this new system. This involved adding a new "Tier 0 Updates" section.
5.  **Outcome:** Storage is no longer a passive numerical upgrade but a dynamic system with distinct strategic implications, directly influencing player choices and reinforcing the Wonder/Dread narrative through unique benefits and risks.
