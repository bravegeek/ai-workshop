## Session 14 Meta-Analysis (2025-11-27) - Propulsion Techs & Core Loop Refinement

### Session Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-11-27
- **Focus:** Replacing generic Advanced Propulsion (T11) with distinct Wonder/Dread propulsion technologies (Gravity Sails, Null-Wake Drive) and refining the core gameplay loop.
- **Model Used:** Gemini
- **Search Queries:** None (internal analysis and creative articulation)

### Agent Reasoning & Design Process

This session aimed to formalize the Propulsion branch's mechanics to ensure it offered meaningful choices that aligned with the Wonder/Dread dichotomy and enhanced the idle game loop.

1.  **Replacing Generic Propulsion:** The previous `T11 Advanced Propulsion` was too vague. It was replaced with two specific Tier 2 technologies:
    *   **T37 Gravity Sails (Wonder):** Implements the "Pipeline" mechanic – passive, permanent resource streams from distant nodes, with a temporary Science Buff during transit. This rewards patience and strategic setup.
    *   **T38 Null-Wake Drive (Dread):** Implements the "Raid" mechanic – instant, massive resource bursts from distant nodes, but with the "Chronological Erosion" penalty, reinforcing active, high-risk gameplay.
2.  **Refining the Core Gameplay Loop:** The "Call to Adventure" section was updated to explicitly mention T37/T38 and their respective "Pipeline" and "Raid" mechanics as the key driver for players to choose propulsion. This addresses the question of how propulsion benefits different archetypes by tying it directly to their resource acquisition strategies.
3.  **Tech Tree Integration:** The Mermaid diagram, Branch Distribution table, and Detailed Technology List in `session.md` were all updated to reflect these new technologies, their dependencies, and their impact on total tech count and W/D scores.
4.  **Outcome:** The Propulsion branch now offers a compelling, idle-friendly strategic choice, further solidifying the game's core design. The total technology count is now 38, with a balanced +45 Wonder / +45 Dread.
