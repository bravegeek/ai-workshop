### Agent Reasoning & Design Process

This session aimed to create a "North Star" document for the game's core feel, ensuring all future design decisions align with the intended player experience.

1.  **Distilling the Core Contrast:** We synthesized all previous mechanics (Tick Rate, Automation, Storage, UI Glitches) into overarching gameplay philosophies for W+ and D+. The goal was to move beyond feature lists to an emotional and experiential description.
2.  **Analogies and Summaries:** The user's input of "luxury car" vs. "rat rod with rocket engine" was integrated as it perfectly encapsulated the intended feel for replayability. A clear summary table was created for quick reference.
3.  **Documentation:** A new "Gameplay Experience" section was added to `session.md` to serve as a high-level guide for all future design and development.
4.  **Outcome:** We now have a clear, concise statement of the game's intended player experience, which will be invaluable for maintaining thematic and mechanical consistency as we flesh out remaining branches and details.
