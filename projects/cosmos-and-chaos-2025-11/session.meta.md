## Session 17 Meta-Analysis (2025-11-27) - Consciousness Branch & Crew Mechanics

### Session Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-11-27
- **Focus:** Fleshing out the "Consciousness" branch and defining underlying "Crew Mechanics."
- **Model Used:** Gemini
- **Search Queries:** None (internal analysis and creative brainstorming)

### Agent Reasoning & Design Process

This session aimed to resolve the "dead end" in the Consciousness branch and establish the foundational mechanics for Crew interaction.

1.  **Crew Mechanics Definition:** Realized that the Consciousness branch's effects on "skills" and "brains" required a defined crew system.
    *   **Crew Count:** Established as a hardware cap for building efficiency, increased by Habitats.
    *   **Proficiency:** Introduced as a global, leveling (1-150) metric for overall station efficiency (+1% per level). Gained over time, accelerated by some techs, reduced by Dread techs.
2.  **Consciousness Branch Expansion (Tiers 2-4):**
    *   **T13 Brain-Computer Interface (Tier 2, Balanced):** Renamed and set as the entry point, boosting Proficiency Gain.
    *   **Tier 3 Choice (New Divergence):**
        *   **T45 Gestalt Networking (Wonder):** Focuses on synchronized learning, doubling Proficiency Gain and increasing its cap (Mastery).
        *   **T46 Direct Behavior Control (Dread):** Allows "Crunch Mode" for global speed boosts at the cost of Morale and stopping Proficiency Gain ("Forced Labor").
    *   **Tier 4 Final Choice (Ultimate Fate):**
        *   **T47 The Noosphere Resonator (Wonder - replaced T26):** Crew "ascends" to pure thought, allowing "Reality Formatting" (map manipulation) via high Proficiency.
        *   **T48 The Synaptic Lattice (Dread):** Allows "Memory Burn" (instant project completion) by sacrificing Proficiency levels, with the delayed negative effect of "Phantom Echoes" (Dissonance Glitches from scrambled memories).
3.  **Dissonance Integration:** Explicitly linked the "Phantom Echoes" effect of The Synaptic Lattice to the existing "Dissonance" mechanic, reinforcing its role as the global "bad stuff" meter.
4.  **Tech Tree & Distribution Updates:** The tech tree diagram and branch distribution table were updated to include these 6 new technologies, bringing the total to 48.
5.  **Outcome:** The Consciousness branch now offers a compelling narrative arc about the fate of the crew, integrated with a functional Crew Mechanics system that leverages both Wonder and Dread playstyles.

**Next Steps:** Detail the "Xenoarchaeology" Artifacts.
