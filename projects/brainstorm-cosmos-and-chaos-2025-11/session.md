# Cosmos and Chaos - Brainstorming Session

## Game Concept

**Name:** Cosmos and Chaos

**Genre:** Idle Game with Progressive Discovery

**Core Mechanic:** Asteroid mining and space-based resource refining with technology tree progression

**Game Nature:**
- **Idle game** - Low stress, casual experience
- **Survival is guaranteed** - Player cannot die/fail
- **Real challenge** - Technology upgrade choices and optimization
- **Not a survival game** - Asteroid interaction is thematic, not threatening

## Design Philosophy

**Progressive Design Approach:**
- Don't need to know the ending to get started
- Iterative development mindset
- Build and expand organically

**Core Strategic Vision:**
- Player progresses up a technology tree
- Key tension: **balancing immediate benefits vs long-term benefits**
- Trade-offs between "benefits now vs benefits later"

---

## Story & Universe

**Setting:**
- Mankind now lives among the planets
- Orbital manufacturing has blossomed
- Need for raw materials has soared
- Cheap fusion power makes asteroid mining profitable
- Raw materials extracted from asteroids and refined in space

**Starting Point:**
- Player begins as a **lonely asteroid miner**
- Small-scale operation in the early days of the mining boom
- Part of humanity's expanding industrial presence in space

**Narrative Arc: Mystery/Discovery**
- Mining is just the beginning
- Something larger is revealed as player ventures deeper into space
- Progressive discovery aligns with iterative design philosophy
- "Don't need every detail upfront" fits naturally with discovery theme

**Multiple Player Goals:**
Players can pursue different achievement paths:
1. **Industrial Magnate** - Economic/business achievement path (builder/optimizer playstyle)
2. **Intrepid Explorer** - Discovery/exploration path (wanderer playstyle)
3. **Unlock the Cosmos** - Mystery/revelation path (seeker playstyle)

These paths create replayability and player agency while maintaining thematic unity under the "Cosmos and Chaos" theme.

## CRI Brainstorming Session Progress

### Session 1: Game Design & Mechanics

**Framework:** Context, Role, Interview
**Expert Role:** Strategic Game Designer (player psychology and meaningful choice design)
**Focus Area:** Game Design & Mechanics

### Phase 1: Context ✓

Established core concept and design philosophy (see above)

### Phase 2: Role ✓

Selected **Strategic Game Designer** role - focusing on:
- Decision tension
- Risk/reward balance
- Pacing
- Making choices feel impactful without overwhelming players

### Phase 3: Interview (In Progress)

#### Question 1: Decision Point Frequency ✓

**Decision:** Real-time decision-making during waves

Players make technology tree decisions continuously during waves, not between them. This creates:
- Active gameplay with constant strategic pressure
- Real-time tension between spending NOW vs saving for long-term upgrades
- Dynamic decision-making environment

#### Question 2: Technology Tree Interaction Model ✓

**Decision:** Hybrid - Persistent Sidebar + Contextual Highlights

Interface design:
- **Persistent sidebar** showing full tech tree at all times
- **Contextual highlights/pop-ups** that intelligently suggest relevant upgrades based on current situation
- Players can explore freely but get guidance to prevent decision paralysis
- Quick-access without pausing the action

Benefits:
- Constant visibility and accessibility
- Smart guidance reduces cognitive load
- Creates good learning curve
- Prevents overwhelming new players

#### Question 3: Tech Tree Progression Model ✓

**Decision:** Hybrid - Unlocks + Flexible Investment

Progression system:
- **Foundational Prerequisites:** Core defensive/economic systems built in sequence (e.g., Basic Shields → Advanced Shields → Energy Barriers)
- **Flexible Investment Pool:** Some powerful technologies always visible but cost-gated, allowing players to save for big jumps
- **Breakthrough Moments:** Certain key technologies unlock entire new branches (e.g., "Quantum Research" opens quantum-based defense tree)
- **Strategic Tension:** Balance building foundations vs saving for breakthroughs vs exploiting immediate tactical opportunities

#### Question 4: Technology Acquisition Mechanics (Paused)

**Under Consideration:** How players actually acquire and upgrade technologies during gameplay

Options being evaluated:
- **A.** Wave-Pause Research System (structured planning windows)
- **B.** Real-Time Passive Research (background research with queuing)
- **C.** Active Resource Investment (manual allocation during waves)
- **D.** Hybrid: Instant Purchase + Passive Unlocks (tactical + strategic split)

*Session paused to refine game nature and narrative direction*

### Session 2: Narrative & Universe Development (In Progress)

**Focus:** Developing the story, universe, and mystery/discovery narrative arc

**Framework:** Context, Role, Interview
**Current Phase:** Role Selection

#### Phase 1: Context ✓

**Game Nature Refined:**
- Clarified as idle game where survival is guaranteed
- Challenge is technology optimization, not survival
- Shifted from "defense" framing to "mining/industrial" framing

**Story Foundation Established:**
- Lonely asteroid miner start
- Orbital manufacturing economy
- Cheap fusion power enables profitability
- Mystery/Discovery narrative arc
- Multiple player goal paths (Industrial Magnate, Intrepid Explorer, Unlock the Cosmos)

#### Phase 2: Role Selection (Current)

**Expert Role Options Being Considered:**
- **A.** Game Design Architect - Idle/incremental mechanics, balancing multiple paths
- **B.** Narrative Systems Designer - Environmental storytelling, mystery through mechanics
- **C.** Player Experience Strategist - Player psychology, multiple motivations
- **D.** Systemic Game Designer - Interconnected systems, emergent gameplay

## Key Design Decisions Summary

| Aspect | Decision | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Game Nature** | Idle game, no death, low stress | Challenge is optimization, not survival |
| **Core Mechanic** | Asteroid mining & refining | Fits idle game better than defense |
| **Narrative Arc** | Mystery/Discovery | Aligns with progressive design philosophy |
| **Player Goals** | Multiple paths (Industrial/Explorer/Cosmic) | Player agency and replayability |
| **Decision Timing** | Real-time during waves | Active engagement, constant strategic pressure |
| **UI/UX** | Persistent sidebar + contextual highlights | Accessibility + guidance without overwhelm |
| **Progression** | Hybrid (prerequisites + flexible + breakthroughs) | Strategic depth with freedom and clear goals |
| **Acquisition** | TBD | Paused for narrative development |
