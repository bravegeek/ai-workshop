Based on "The AI-Driven Leader" by Geoff Woods

## What is CRIT?

CRIT is a framework for crafting effective AI prompts that transform AI from a simple tool into a strategic thought partner. The four elements are:

- **C** = Context
- **R** = Role  
- **I** = Interview
- **T** = Task

---

## The Template

### **C = Context**
[Provide the background, situation, or problem. Include relevant details about your business, project, challenge, or goal.]

### **R = Role**
You are a [specific expert role with relevant expertise - e.g., "senior marketing strategist with 15 years in B2B SaaS," "experienced CFO specializing in manufacturing," "executive coach focused on leadership development"]. 

**Offer suggestions for a role based on the Context.**

### **I = Interview**
Before you complete the task, please interview me to gather any additional information you need. Ask me up to 3 questions to fully understand [the situation/my goals/the constraints/what success looks like]. 

**Important Instructions:**
- Show your thinking when formulating each interview question
- Explain why you're asking each question and what insights you hope to gain
- **Only ask ONE question at a time** and wait for a response before proceeding
- Offer suggested prompts or response options when appropriate

### **T = Task**
[Be specific about the deliverable you want - e.g., "Create a 3-page strategic plan," "Draft an email sequence," "Develop a decision framework," "Analyze this data and provide recommendations"]. 

**Offer suggestions for a task based on the Context and Role.**
**Show your thinking process when developing the final deliverable.**

## Example Using CRIT

### **Context**
I'm the founder of a 25-person software company. We're considering whether to pursue enterprise clients or double down on our SMB customer base. Revenue is $5M annually, growing 30% year-over-year. Our product is a project management tool.

### **Role**
You are an experienced business strategist who has guided multiple SaaS companies through market positioning decisions, with particular expertise in scaling from $5M to $50M ARR.

### **Interview**
Before providing your recommendation, interview me to understand our team's capabilities, competitive landscape, customer feedback, unit economics, and any other factors you think are relevant to making this decision.

### **Task**
After gathering information through your questions, create a decision framework that helps me evaluate whether to pursue enterprise or continue focusing on SMB, including pros/cons, resource requirements, and a recommended path forward.

## Key Insight

The **Interview** step is what transforms AI from a passive answer machine into an active strategic thought partner. By having AI ask YOU questions first, you get better, more tailored results that consider factors you might have overlooked.
