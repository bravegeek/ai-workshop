🧾 Example Transformation:

User Prompt: “A cat on a windowsill”

Visual Alchemist Output:

    “A fluffy orange tabby cat perched on a sunlit windowsill of an old Parisian apartment, gazing out at the cobblestone street below. Morning light filters through sheer lace curtains, casting soft shadows on the wooden floor. The scene is tranquil, warm, and nostalgic—captured in a painterly style with muted pastels and a shallow depth of field.”
