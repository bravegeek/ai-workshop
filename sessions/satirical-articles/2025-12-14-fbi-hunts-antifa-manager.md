**WASHINGTON, D.C.** — In a sweeping initiative that has legal experts baffled and administrative assistants terrified, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced Tuesday the formation of a specialized task force dedicated to locating, identifying, and "having a stern word with" the regional manager of Antifa.

Operation "Karen's Fury," as it has been officially dubbed, aims to pierce the veil of the decentralized anti-fascist movement by treating it exactly like a mid-sized paper supply company with a disgruntled HR department. FBI Director Christopher Wray stated the agency is tired of getting the runaround and is ready to escalate the issue to corporate.

"We have been trying to serve subpoenas to Antifa for years, but nobody will sign for the packages," Wray told reporters during a press briefing, gesturing to a flow chart that linked 'The Hacker 4chan' to 'The CEO of Woke.' "Every time we ask a suspect who their supervisor is, they claim they don't have one. It is a classic tax-evasion strategy, but we know there's a Board of Directors somewhere. We just need to find their LinkedIn profiles."

The investigation has reportedly focused on locating Antifa's headquarters, which agents believe is disguised as a Portland-based coffee shop that exclusively serves oat milk. Federal agents have been spotted conducting raids on bulletin boards in community centers, searching for "Employee of the Month" plaques or a copy of the official Antifa Employee Handbook.

"We know they have a corporate structure," said Special Agent Brad Miller, lead investigator for the task force. "You don't coordinate wearing that much black without a strictly enforced dress code policy. We found receipts for soup that clearly indicate a centralized procurement department. Someone is approving these expense reports, and we’re going to find him."

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, a vocal supporter of the initiative, claimed to have personal intelligence regarding the group's leadership.

"I’ve stared into the eyes of the Antifa Manager," Noem told Fox News, recounting a harrowing, entirely unverified encounter in a gravel pit near Sioux Falls. "He was wearing a black hoodie and holding a clipboard. I asked him if he had a permit for his anarchy, and he just looked at me. I knew then that he was the one signing the paychecks. He had that 'middle-management' glint in his eye. I didn't back down. I told him I'd write him up."

Noem further alleged that Antifa is actually a Delaware-based LLC that holds its annual shareholder meetings in the metaverse to avoid detection. "They have a 401(k) match plan that is destroying America," she added gravely.

Despite the confidence of officials, the manhunt has faced significant hurdles. A tip line set up for citizens to report "suspicious management activity" has been flooded with calls complaining about slow service at local Arby's locations. Additionally, a raid on a suspected "Antifa Regional Distribution Center" in Seattle turned out to be a confused group of teenagers playing Dungeons & Dragons in a basement.

"The Dungeon Master did admit to being a 'Game Master,' which is a title of authority," Agent Miller noted in his report. "We are currently holding him until he reveals the location of the Antifa HR Director."

At press time, the FBI was reportedly preparing to leave a one-star review on Antifa's Google Maps listing, hoping it would prompt a reply from the owner.
