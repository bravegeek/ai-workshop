# Session Notes - ACEs and Depression Research

## Session Date
November 16, 2025

## Brainstorming Method
**CRI Framework** (Context, Role, Interview) using strategic-brainstorm-researcher agent

## Session Flow

### Phase 1: Context
- **Topic:** Adverse childhood experiences linked with depression
- **Primary Interest:** Research/Academic + Public Health/Policy
- **Initial Direction:** Design new research study with adolescents + analyze existing ACEs data
- **Pivot:** Shifted focus to literature review instead of specific study design

### Phase 2: Role Selection
**Selected Role:** Public Health Researcher specializing in ACEs and Mental Health Epidemiology

**Why this role:**
- Deep knowledge of research methodology and epidemiological patterns
- Expertise in evidence synthesis
- Strong on both research rigor and population-level mental health outcomes
- Bridges academic research and public health applications

### Phase 3: Strategic Interview
**Key Clarifications:**
- Focus on adolescent populations
- Interest in both research foundations and practical applications
- Preference for comprehensive literature review over specific study design

### Phase 4: Research Planning
**Deliverable:** Comprehensive landscape analysis covering:
- Seminal papers and foundational research
- Key researchers and research groups
- Major theoretical frameworks
- Neurobiological mechanisms
- Measurement tools and screening instruments
- Protective factors and resilience
- Health equity and disparities
- Evidence-based interventions
- Research gaps and future directions
- Actionable next steps

## Key Insights

### Research Foundations
- Field has matured significantly since Felitti et al. (1998) original ACE Study
- Strong dose-response relationship: 4+ ACEs = 4x higher depression risk
- Recent systematic reviews (2023-2024) provide robust evidence base

### Theoretical Evolution
- Movement from **Cumulative Risk Model** (simple ACE scoring)
- To **Dimensional Model (DMAP)** - threat vs. deprivation pathways
- Recognition of timing, severity, and context in adversity impact

### Critical Findings
- **Protective Factors Matter:** 3-5 Positive Childhood Experiences = 50% lower depression odds
- **Health Equity Critical:** Structural racism and social determinants must be addressed
- **Adolescent-Specific Gaps:** Less research on proximal adolescent impacts vs. adult outcomes

## Next Steps

1. Review landscape analysis in detail
2. Identify priority papers to read first (see Phase 1 recommendations)
3. Develop detailed search protocol
4. Consider which review approach best fits goals:
   - Systematic/scoping review (comprehensive, replicable)
   - Narrative/critical review (thematic, gap analysis)
   - Rapid evidence assessment (focused, practical)

## Agent Performance
The strategic-brainstorm-researcher agent:
- Successfully guided through CRI framework
- Adapted when direction changed (study design → literature review)
- Conducted actual web research to provide concrete findings
- Provided actionable, structured recommendations
- Balanced breadth (comprehensive coverage) with depth (specific details)
